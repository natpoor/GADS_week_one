GADS_week_one
=============

This repo is for the GADS homework from week one, converting part of the bike data from JSON to CSV.
I am making this repo to learn more about GitHub interfaces and such, web, the app, or CLI. 
(Hmm in the web interface it is not immediately obvious how to save... Oh below the fold, had to scroll!)
